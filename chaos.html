        <p>The Chaos Spring, built in 2013,  is located in beautiful, sunny Miami Florida. Owned by the magnificent Alisson Haynes, The Chaos Spring is the ultimate party destination for entertainment and nightlife. The club gets its name for the wide range of performance genres it supports, making each night at the club feel new and different. The Chaos Spring makes an effort to support local artists of all levels of renown. We invite influential musicians and artists but also those who are trying to get their first taste of performance. And with this always changing style, the club dress code also changes: from leather jackets and ripped jeans to cocktail dresses and high heels. So come as you are or dress for the occasion here at The Chaos Spring, where mayhem blooms.</p>

          <h2>The Groovy 70s!</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>For tonight, the dress is inspired by the 70s! We at The Chaos Spring wanted to bring to life the joy and wonder of the age of Disco! In the 1970s, disco arrived armed with keyboards, drum machines, sugary lyrics, and extended dance breaks. Artists such as the BeeGees, ABBA, and Donna Summer crooned their way into the hearts of people in America, Europe, and beyond. Come out in your most eye-catching bell-bottom jeans, big sunglasses, floral dresses and shimmering fabric.
          <br>Let Mayhem Bloom in your 70s Groove!</p>
